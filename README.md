# DeepLearningLabs
A repository for hosting labs for the
[DeepLearning](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/DeepLearning-2018Spring)  course of the master
in Data Science Engineering at [Eurecom](http://www.eurecom.fr) held by
professor Benoit Huet.

The 3 labs cover the following material:
* **lab1**: Artificial Neural Networks for Handwritten Digits
  Recognition
* **lab2**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Handwritten Digits
  Recognition
* **lab3**: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for Language Modeling

The labs are jointly done with Jupyter Notebooks by:
* [Matteo Romiti](http://www.github.com/MatteoRomiti)
* [Daniele Reda](http://www.github.com/rdednl)
